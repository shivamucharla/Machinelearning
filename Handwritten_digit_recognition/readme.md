## Handwritten Digit Recognition
-** This project implements a handwritten digit recognition system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Keras on the MNIST dataset. The model is trained to classify images of handwritten digits (0-9) and can predict digits from new images.

5. Steps
Import Libraries: Import necessary libraries such as Keras, OpenCV, and Matplotlib.
Load Data: Load the MNIST dataset using Keras.
Preprocess Data:
Reshape the training and testing images to include the channel dimension.
Normalize the pixel values to the range [0, 1].
Convert the class labels to categorical format.
Create the Model:
Build a CNN model with two convolutional layers followed by max pooling and dropout layers.
Add dense layers for classification.
Compile the Model: Compile the model using categorical crossentropy loss and the Adadelta optimizer.
Train the Model: Fit the model on the training data and validate it on the test data.
Make Predictions:
Load new handwritten digit images.
Resize and preprocess the images to match the model's input shape.
Predict the digits using the trained model.

5. Model Architecture
The model architecture consists of:

Convolutional Layers: Two Conv2D layers with ReLU activation.
Pooling Layer: One MaxPooling2D layer to reduce dimensionality.
Dropout Layers: Two Dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
Fully Connected Layers: One Dense layer with 256 neurons and a final Dense layer for classification (10 classes).

6. Results
The model is trained for 10 epochs with a batch size of 128. The training and validation accuracy will be displayed during the training process.

7. Usage
To run the digit recognition script, ensure you have the sample images (1.png, 2.png, 3.png, 4.png) in the same directory. Execute the following command:

bash
Copy code
python mnist_digits_recognition.py
The script will print the predicted digit for each image and display the images.
