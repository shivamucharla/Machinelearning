## Single Feature Linear Regression

- Applied linear regression using only the 'MedInc' (median income) feature.
- Plotted the best-fit line to visualize the relationship.

## Linear Regression with All Features

- Utilized linear regression with all available features.
- Plotted the best-fit line to understand the overall impact of features.

## Linear Regression with Subset of Features

- Conducted linear regression using the first four features.
- Evaluated linear regression using the last four features.
- Compared the scores of full features and the last four features, concluding that all features provide the best prediction accuracy.

## Dependencies
