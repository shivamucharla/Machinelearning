#Movie Recommender System
##Overview
*This project implements a Movie Recommender System using collaborative filtering techniques. The system predicts movie ratings for users based on the ratings provided by similar users, or similar movies. It utilizes matrix factorization techniques such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to make recommendations.

##Features
Collaborative Filtering: Recommends movies based on user and item interactions.
Matrix Factorization: Uses SVD for dimensionality reduction and accurate prediction of ratings.
Evaluation: The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values and normalizes user ratings for improved performance.
##Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of:

##Movie Ratings: User ratings of various movies.


Installation
To run this project, you'll need the following dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook: Open the movie_recommender_system.ipynb notebook and run all cells sequentially.
Modify Dataset Path: If necessary, modify the dataset path inside the notebook to match the location of your dataset.
Evaluate the Model: The notebook includes evaluation code to measure the performance of the model.
Files
movie_recommender_system.ipynb: The Jupyter notebook containing all the code for building the recommender system.
Results
The model outputs the predicted ratings for a set of movies, which can be used to recommend movies to users. Additionally, it displays error metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate the model's accuracy.
Ran the streamlit in the pycharm to give the output recommendatoions.
##Future Improvements
Hybrid Methods: Implement hybrid recommender systems combining content-based filtering with collaborative filtering.
Advanced Models: Use deep learning-based methods like Autoencoders for better performance.
