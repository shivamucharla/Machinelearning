# Introduction
This repository serves as a collection of machine learning projects covering various aspects of supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning techniques. It is designed to be a resource for those interested in learning and experimenting with different machine learning algorithms and applications.

# Requirements
Each project may have specific requirements, which can be found in the respective project's folder. Generally, this repository requires:

Python 3.x
Common machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow or PyTorch, pandas, and numpy
Data visualization libraries like matplotlib and seaborn
Refer to each project's README or requirements.txt file for detailed dependencies.

# Installation
To clone and set up this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ML-Project-Repository.git
cd ML-Project-Repository
After cloning, install the dependencies by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Each project folder may contain its own requirements.txt for specific dependencies.

# Usage
